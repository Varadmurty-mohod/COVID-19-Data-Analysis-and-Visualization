# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-COURSERA-
In this project we are going to use COVID19 dataset we have consisting of the data related cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, and deaths cases. we are going to prepare this dataset to answer these questions: How does the Global Spread of the virus look like?, How intensive the spread of the virus has been in the countries? Does covid19 national lockdowns and self-isolations in different countries have actually impact on COVID19 transmission? we are going to use Plotly module, which is a great visualization tool in python, in order to plot some insightful and intuitive graphs to answer the questions.
